RED LIST:
friis() function: It appears that the function is using the Friis equation, which is used to calculate the maximum range of a communication system, but it is not clear how the input data is being used in the calculation.

freq_hopping() function: This function is using frequency hopping spread spectrum, which is a technique to improve resistance to interference and provide a higher data rate, but it is not clear how the input data is being used in the calculation.

forward_error_correction() function: This function is using forward error correction, which is a technique to improve the reliability of a communication system by adding redundant data to the signal, but it is not clear how the input data is being used in the calculation, and the error rate is hardcoded to 0.5.

interweaving_helix() function: This function is using interweaving helixes, which is a technique to compress encoded data, but it is not clear how the input data is being used in the calculation.

ad_hoc() function: This function is using ad-hoc communication and enhancement of network performance, but it is not clear how the input data is being used in the calculation.

interweaving_helix_tar() function: This function is using interweaving helixes, but it is not clear how the input data is being used in the calculation.

encode_baseX_complex() function: This function is using baseX encoding and decoding to include imaginary numbers for additional dimensions, but it is not clear how the input data is being used in the calculation, and the base is hardcoded to the modulo_value.

lookup_table_encode() function: This function is using a lookup table and key to encode and decode the data, but it is not clear how the input data is being used in the calculation, and the key is not defined.

fourier_transform_12phase() function: This function is performing a Fourier transform on the input data, but it is not clear how the input data is being used in the calculation and the phase shift is hardcoded to 1.

final_code() function: This function is calling all the above functions, but it is not clear how the input data is being used in the calculation, and the output is not being returned.

eliminate_neuron() function: This function is supposed to eliminate the neuron that sent the tampered data, but it is not clear how it is being implemented.

stored_hash() function: This function is supposed to store the hash of the data, but it is not clear how it is being implemented, and the data and nonce variables are not defined.

public_key() function: This function is supposed to store the public key, but it is not clear how it is being implemented, and the private_key variable is not defined.

private_key() function: This function is supposed to store the private key, but it is not clear how it is being implemented.
